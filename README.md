# UNEP Project Manager
A CRUD web application for managing project details.
I developed the ‘UNEP Project Manager’ web app using the PHP CodeIgniter and Bootstrap frameworks and a MySQL database.
To install the app, clone the repository and place it in the htdocs of your xampp/lamp/wamp server folder. 
Import the database and navigate to localhost/unepprojectmanager in your browser.
The database dump is ‘projectmanager.sql’ and is located in the root of the folder.    
It allows the user to: -

•	Fetch the project data from the database and list them on the home page.

•	View individual project records.

•	Add new project records to the database.

•	Edit and update individual project records in the database.

•	Delete individual project records from the database.

•	Links to expose project details as JSON.

• Search to find projects using key-words on the home page.

•	Project list on the homepage and links to subsequent pages using CodeIgniter Pagination library.

• Pretty URL (i.e. No 'index.php').
